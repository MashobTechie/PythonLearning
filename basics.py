# Problem Challenge: Student Gradebook System

# Write a Python program that simulates a simple gradebook for a university department.

# Requirements:

# Accept student records (name, matric number, and a list of courses with scores). 
# Example:

# {
#     "name": "Aisha Musa",
#     "matric": "STA/2021/011",
#     "courses": {
#         "MTH101": 65,
#         "STA103": 80,
#         "CSC105": 72
#     }
# }
 
# Support these features:

# Add a new student.
# Update a studentâ€™s score in a course.
# Compute GPA for a student (assume: A=5, B=4, C=3, D=2, F=0; GPA = weighted average).
# List the top 3 students by GPA.
# Save all student data to a JSON file and load it back when the program restarts.
